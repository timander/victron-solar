# victron-solar
project for processing solar charge control data


this is a new project. One of the modules victron-python will be a python data pipeline that will help me ingest and process the csv in the data folder into a solar usage summary report and give me a vizualization.

It should use Pip with a toml file for dependencies. Use pydantic for data classes. Use Polars for processing instead of Pandas. Include a makefile for convenience workflow. I also want the code to be written with a TDD approach using PyTest.
Use SOLID principles and best practices to keep this code clean and elegant using idomatic python.
